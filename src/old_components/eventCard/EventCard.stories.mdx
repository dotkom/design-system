# Event Card

This component was designed for use in OWF, but the OWF implementation has since changed, so you could consider this deprecated.

This large event card prominently displays the event image, with the information displayed directly underneath it.

  <Story name="Large">
    <EventCard
      eventName="Nofas"
      date="2019-08-07"
      attending="17/20"
      imgSrc="https://online.ntnu.no/media/images/responsive/sm/0c6f22e2-ff1f-44df-b40b-41ca8d8e12c8.jpeg"
      isLargeEvent={true}
      category="Kurs"
      eventColor="#127DBD"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Small event card

There is a smaller version of the card for more compact viewing. It displays the same information as the larger version, except it doesn't have the image.
