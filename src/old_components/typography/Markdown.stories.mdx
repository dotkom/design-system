# Markdown

Markdown keeps the writers focused on the content and not the design of the content. Keeping content separated from the design of the content has a lot of advantages, like if the design changes.

This the markdown component is borrowed from `markdown-to-jsx`, with a few tweaks to match our design.

## Example usage

<Props of={Markdown} />

<Preview>
  <Story name="Example usage">
    <>
      <Heading>The story of Lorem Ipsum</Heading>
      <Info>Written by Lorem and Ipsum</Info>
      <Ingress>
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
      </Ingress>
      <Markdown>
        {`Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
