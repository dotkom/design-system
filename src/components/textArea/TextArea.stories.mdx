# Text field

This is more or less a `<textarea>` from HTML.
This component supports any props a regular `<input />` [accepts](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp), as well as it's own props listed below.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <TextArea placeholder="I'm resizable!" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props of={TextArea} />

### Input disabled

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Disabled">
    <TextArea defaultValue="disabled" disabled />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Input with label

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Label">
    <TextArea placeholder={'Search...'} label="Label" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Status colors

These colors can be set by setting the `status` prop.  
Red color indicates a critical error, hindering the user in proceeding with what they are doing.  
Yellow color indicates that input _may_ be wrong, but is not validated.
This can also be used to alert users of fields that are usually faulty.
In this scenario, it is useful to set a label with a readable, but matching color.  
Green color indicates that input is correct and validated, and the user can submit, save or continue.

### Input with error

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Error">
    <TextArea defaultValue={'Incorrect input'} status="error" errorMessage="That input was incorrect" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Input with success

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Success">
    <TextArea defaultValue="Correct input" status="success" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Input with warning

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Warning">
    <TextArea placeholder="This field is prone to errors" status="warning" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
