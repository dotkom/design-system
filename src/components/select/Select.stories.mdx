# Select Menu

It's a dropdown, you know what it does. Choose this over a radio button group if you have a lot of options to choose from.

<Preview>
  <Story name="All">
    <Select
      options={[
        { value: 0, label: 'lorem' },
        { value: 1, label: 'ipsum' },
        { value: 2, label: 'dolor' },
        { value: 3, label: 'sit' },
        { value: 4, label: 'amet' },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

Select has no props except for children. It takes any number of option-elements
and displays them in the order they were given.
Select is meant to be used within an HTML-form, and thus does not yield the selected value.

```html
<option value="{x}">Text</option>
```
