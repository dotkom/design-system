# Select Menu

It's a dropdown, you know what it does. Choose this over a radio button group if you have a lot of options to choose from.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="All">
    <Select>
      <option value={0}>Lorem</option>
      <option value={1}>Ipsum</option>
      <option value={2}>Dolor</option>
      <option value={3}>Sit</option>
      <option value={4}>Amet</option>
    </Select>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Select has no props except for children. It takes any number of option-elements 
and displays them in the order they were given.
Select is meant to be used within an  HTML-form, and thus does not yield the selected value. 
```html
<option value={x}>Text</option>
